                    You can actually taste the potatoes and not the bread crumbs, oil, and salt.
                    Add any other spices of your choice.

                    <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

                    <li>Pour olive oil into a large resealable plastic bag and add potatoes.
                        Seal the bag and shake to coat every piece with oil.

                    <li>Combine Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt, and pepper in a second resealable bag.
