            <div class="desc">
                <p>This is a very tasty and easy-to-make Filipino chicken dish made with soy sauce, garlic, and vinegar.
                    I can just as easily double or triple the chicken in this recipe to serve guests at a party.
                    Serve over rice with just a little of the sauce (not too much).

                    <li>In a large pot, mix soy sauce, water, vinegar, honey, garlic, bay leaves, and pepper.
