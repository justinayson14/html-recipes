        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>This is a very tasty and easy-to-make Filipino chicken dish made with soy sauce, garlic, and vinegar.
            I can just as easily double or triple the chicken in this recipe to serve guests at a party.
            Serve over rice with just a little of the sauce (not too much).
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
            <li>3/4 cups vinegar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons honey</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>3 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, mix soy sauce, water, vinegar, honey, garlic, bay leaves, and pepper.
                Bring the mixture to a boil and place the chicken into the pot.
                Reduce heat, cover, and cook 35 to 40 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Remove chicken, drain on paper towels, and set aside.
                Discard bay leaves. Return the mixture to a boil, and cook until reduced to about 1 1/2 cups.
            </li>
            <li>Place chicken on the prepared grill, about 5 minutes on each side, until browned and crips.
                Serve with the remaining soy sauce mixture. 
            </li>
        </ol>
